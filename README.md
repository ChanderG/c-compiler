#TinyC compiler

###What?

A compiler for a made up language called tinyC - a subset of C.

###Build Instructions
Use the Makefile.

```
make
```

To test use the testrunner script:

If there are no problems it will output nothing.


###Issues
* +/- are recogonized for signs and not for punctuators.
* Character definition is wrong.
